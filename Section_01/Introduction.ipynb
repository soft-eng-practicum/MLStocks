    "MLStocks (Jarrod Bailey, Samuel Berende, & Zehra Siddiqui) is a software development group from Dr. Cengiz Gunay's Software Development 2 class. Our semester long project was to work with a real-world client and develop a product based on their requirements that met certain criteria. For our specific project, we worked with Finance Professor Dr. Atul Saxena to create a brief introductory tutorial on stock market security analysis."
