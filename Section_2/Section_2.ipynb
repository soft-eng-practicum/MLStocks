    "### Strings & Print()\n",
    "A **String** is a simple data type that can include letters, numbers, and symbols. Simply speaking, it's a sequence of characters. Strings must be surrounded by a pair of quotation marks. \n",
    "Here's a couple examples: \n",
    " \n",
    " * \"This is a string!\" \n",
    " * \"1234 & 5678\"\n",
    " * \"P Sherman 42 Wallaby Way Sydney\"\n",

    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue further, I want to show you how to comment the code you're working with. Commenting your code makes it easier to understand, both for yourself in the future and for other people. Comments are parts of the code that Python will not try to run. There's two different types of comments: Single-line, and multi-line. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Single-Line** comments are comments that only take up one line in your code. These kinds of comments are good if you need to include very brief information, such as quick notes for what a part of your code does. Single line comments are denoted with a a hashtag ( # ). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-line** comments, on the other hand, can be more thorough and are used for comments that take up multiple lines of code. Muti-line comments can also be used to \"comment-out\" parts of your code, if you do not want it to run. These kinds of comments are denoted by three pairs of quotation marks ( \"\"\" ) on either side of the comment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a couple examples of each: \n",
    "\n",
    "* #This is a single line comment \n",
    "* \"\"\"This is a multi line comment. \n",
    "        Anything I say and/or any code I write will not be run by Python\n",

    "Now you try. First, run the code below to see the output. \n",

    "One way to store and work with different types of data is by using **variables**. Variables stores data under the name you decide to give it. You can **assign** the variable different pieces of data by using the equals ( = ) symbol. \n",

    "\n",
    "myFirstVariable = 24\n",
    "mySecondVariable = \"Hello!\"\n",

    "In each case, the name (myFirstVariable/mySecondVariable) is the name of the variable, but it holds different types of data. One holds a number, and one holds a String. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create two different variables in the cell below and assign them any number or String value you want. Then, print both variables out using two print() functions. Be sure to put the name of your variables inside the print function in order to see it printed out on the screen. \n"
